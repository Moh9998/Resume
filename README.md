## Academic Achievements and Professional Development

I began programming at the age of 13, driven by a passion for technology and problem-solving. Over the years, I have focused on self-learning backend development, specializing in Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript, building a strong foundation in server-side development.

I have gained practical experience in MongoDB, learning schema design, aggregation, and indexing, and built several RESTful APIs with Express.js, implementing features like JWT authentication, role-based access control, and error handling. Refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript helped me improve code clarity and type safety.

My projects include an e-commerce API with payment integration and user authentication, and a blogging platform with role-based access and real-time updates. I have explored core Node.js concepts, written tests with Jest, and deployed applications using Docker and Heroku. Additionally, I've worked with Redis for caching and API optimization.

I consistently follow best practices like clean code principles and backend design patterns, and I continue enhancing my skills through courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera. This journey reflects my dedication to becoming a well-rounded backend developer.
